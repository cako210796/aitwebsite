We propose a computational design tool that allows end-users to create advanced quadrotor trajectories with
        a variety of application scenarios in mind. Our algorithm allows novice users to create quadrotor based use-cases without
        requiring deep knowledge in either quadrotor control or the
        underlying constraints of the target domain. To achieve this
        goal we propose an optimization-based method that generates
        feasible trajectories which can be flown in the real world.
        Furthermore, the method incorporates high-level human objectives
        into the planning of flight trajectories. An easy to
        use 3D design tool allows for quick specification and editing
        of trajectories as well as for intuitive exploration of the
        resulting solution space. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
        in several real-world application scenarios, including
        aerial-videography, robotic light-painting and drone racing.
