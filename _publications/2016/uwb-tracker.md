We present a tracking system based on ultrawideband
(UWB) radio tranceivers mounted on a robot and
a target. In comparison to typical UWB localization systems
with fixed UWB tranceivers in the environment we only require
instrumentation of the target with a single UWB tranceiver. Our
system works in GPS-denied environments and does not suffer
from long-term drift and limited fields of view.
This paper reports the localization algorithm and implementation
details. Additionally, we demonstrate a quantitative
evaluation of the accuracy (10cm average position error for a
square with side-length of 4m) and application scenarios with
a quadrotor flying in close proximity to a person and handling
occlusion of the target.
