We present a Visual Inertial Odometry system
that enables the autonomous flight of Micro Aerial Vehicles
in GPS denied and unstructured environments. The system
relies on commercially available and affordable hardware both
for sensing and computation. The algorithm runs in real time
on an ARM based embedded micro-computer on-board an
MAV. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance of
the system both indoors and outdoors, in hand held an inflight
scenarios. The achieved accuracy of the experiments is
competitive with other research which uses custom designed
hardware and desktop-grade processors.
