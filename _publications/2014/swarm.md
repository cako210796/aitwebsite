<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Some aerial tasks are achieved more efficiently
and at a lower cost by a group of independently controlled
micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) when compared to a single, more
sophisticated robot. Controlling formation flight can be cast
as a two-level problem: stabilization of relative distances of
agents (formation shape control) and control of the center
of gravity of the formation. To date, accurate shape control
of a formation of MAVs usually relies on external tracking
devices (e.g. fixed cameras) or signals (e.g. GPS) and uses
centralized control, which severely limits its deployment. In
this paper, we present an environment-independent approach
for relative MAV formation flight, using a distributed control
algorithm which relies only on embedded sensing and agentto-
agent communication. In particular, an on-board monocular
camera is used to acquire relative distance measurements in
combination with a consensus-based distributed Kalman filter.
We evaluate our methods in- and outdoors with a formation of
three MAVs while controlling the formation’s center of gravity
manually.</p>
