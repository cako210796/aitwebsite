<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Studierstube and DWARF are modular Augmented Reality frameworks, each with distinct advantages in different application areas. Both can easily be extended by adding new components. In this case study we show how new components can act as a bridge between the frameworks. By facilitating the exchange of basic data types such as pose and user input, the frameworks become interoperable. This allows us to build new applications leveraging the advantages of both frameworks, while fostering cooperation between research groups.</p>
