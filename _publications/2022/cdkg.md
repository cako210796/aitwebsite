Kinesthetic garments provide physical feedback on body posture and motion through tailored distributions of reinforced
material. Their ability to selectively stiffen a garmentâ€™s response to specific motions makes them appealing for rehabilitation,
sports, robotics, and many other application fields. However, finding designs that distribute a given amount of reinforcement
material to maximally stiffen the response to specified motions is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose an
optimization-driven approach for automated design of reinforcement patterns for kinesthetic garments. Our main contribution
is to cast this design task as an on-body topology optimization problem. Our method allows designers to explore a continuous
range of designs corresponding to various amounts of reinforcement coverage. Our model captures both tight contact and
lift-off separation between cloth and body. We demonstrate our method on a variety of reinforcement design problems for
different body sites and motions. Optimal designs lead to a two- to threefold improvement in performance in terms of energy
density. A set of manufactured designs were consistently rated as providing more resistance than baselines in a comparative
user study.
