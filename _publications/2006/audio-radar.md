<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Collections of electronic music are mostly organized according to playlists based on artist names and song titles. Music genres are inherently ambiguous and, to make matters worse, assigned manually by a diverse user community. People tend to organize music based on similarity to other music and based on the music’s emotional qualities. Taking this into account, we have designed a music player which derives a set of criteria from the actual music data and then provides a coherent visual metaphor for a similarity-based navigation of the music collection.</p>
