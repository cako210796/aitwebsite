<h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a joint Ph.D. student between <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://ait.inf.ethz.ch" target="_blank">Advanced Interactive Technologies lab</a> and 
      <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/" target="_blank">DisneyResearch|Studios</a>. Prior to that, I  received my M.Sc. in Computer Science at ETH Zürich (2022) and my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology (2020).

    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>
    My research primarily focuses on advancing deep generative modeling for human-based applications, such as generating full-body human images. More specifically, I am interested in enhancing the capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models to enable more scalable and controllable content creation.
