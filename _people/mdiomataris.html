<h2>Biography </h2>
    <p> I'm a doctoral fellow in the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS), a joint program between  <a class="a-text-ext" href="http://www.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">ETH 
      Zurich</a> and <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://www.is.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a>. I am supervised by <a href="https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges/" title="_blank">Prof. Otmar Hilliges</a>,
      <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://ps.is.mpg.de/~black" title="_blank">Prof.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> Considering what humans are able to understand about other humans it becomes apparent that our perception goes far beyond (while surely leveraging) our geometric aspect and is able to infer semantic information such as goals, (inter)actions, intentions etc. My goal is to bridge the gap between geometry and semantics so that machines can truly understand humans and therefore more intelligently learn from, interact with and assist them.
