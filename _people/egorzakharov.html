<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  I received my Ph.D. from <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://www.skoltech.ru">Skoltech</a>, under the supervision of <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gYYVokYAAAAJ">Victor Lempitsky</a>. 
  During my Ph.D., I also worked at <a class="a-text-ext" href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter">Samsung AI Center</a>, where, for last two years, I led a team focused on human head avatars.
</p>
<p>
  For my doctoral thesis, I primarily leveraged generative modeling of in-the-wild data for the task of one- and few-shot synthesis of human avatars.
</p>
<p>
  My current research interests revolve around 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes using in-the-wild data. The aim is to use physics simulation and physics-based rendering as priors to both improve the accuracy of reconstructions, and to make them readily available for use in downstream applications.
