<h2>Biography </h2>
    <p> I am a second-year PhD student supervised by <a href="https://eth-ait.github.io/aitwebsite/people/hilliges" title="_blank">Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges</a>. 
    I obtained my Computer Science Master's degree at ETH Zürich in 2021.
    <br>
    <br>
    My research interests lie in human-centric computer vision ranging from basic understandings of human-centric videos,
    such as human recognition and pose estimation, to more complicated generative tasks, such as motion prediction and full-body generation.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Recently, I focus on incorporating user control signals, such as image-based guidance or text prompts, to generative models for producing high-quality, user-specific 3D avatars.
    I am interested in learning controllable generative models with limited 3D supervision and incorporating large-scale generative priors to create diverse avatars. 
    <br>

<h2>Projects for Prospective Master's Students</h2>
    <p>
    I am actively looking for self-motivated students who have an interest in 3D human avatars and generative modeling. You are also welcome to reach out if you want to propose your own project.
