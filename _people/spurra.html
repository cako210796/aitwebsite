 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, human computer interaction and vision, focusing on leveraging sparsely or weakly labeled data. My current reserach focus lies in the following domains:
    </p>
 <ul class="bullets">
        <li> 3D hand pose estimation from monocular RGB </li>
        <li> Reducing the reliance on fully labeled data for computer vision</li>
    </ul>
