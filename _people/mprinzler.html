<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student with the <a href="https://learning-systems.org/">Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://justusthies.github.io/">Justus Thies</a> (MPI) and <a href="https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges/">Otmar Hilliges</a> (ETH).
      My research focuses on reconstructing photo-realistic 3D avatars of the human head with affordable capturing hardware.
      Such technology will be a crucial step towards next-gen telecommunication and entertainment, e.g.,  in immersive 3D video-conferencing and VR gaming.
      <br>
      <br>
      Before my Ph.D., I obtained a Master's Degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en">Heidelberg University</a> and studied at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/">Prof. Erik G. Learned-Miller</a>.
      Further, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern at <a href="https://www.sas.com">SAS Institue</a>.
